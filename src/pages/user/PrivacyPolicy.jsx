												representatives of organisations who engage Credibled to
												assist them with the hiring of Candidates, referred to
												as Employers);
											</p>

												Service providers may process the information for us,
												but only ever for the sole purpose of providing our
												services. Where a service provider holds your
												information, we require them to adhere to our approved
												standards of security to ensure the continuing
												protection of your personal information. Only authorised
